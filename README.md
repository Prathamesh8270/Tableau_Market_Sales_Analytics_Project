📊 Market Sales Analytics Dashboard – Tableau + SQL
Welcome to my interactive Market Sales Analytics project, where I transform raw SQL data into actionable insights using Tableau. This dashboard helps businesses understand market-wise performance, product trends, and customer behavior through clear, interactive visualizations.

🧰 Tech Stack
SQL – for data extraction, cleaning, and preprocessing

Tableau – for data visualization and dashboard interactivity

MySQL Workbench / DBeaver – to explore and restore the .sql database

📌 Features
